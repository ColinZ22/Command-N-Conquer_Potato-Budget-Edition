# Command N Conquer (Potato Budget Edition)

## What's this?
This is a round-based 2-player game inspired by the Command & Conquer game series.
I've always loved Command & Conquer and made lots of fun childhood memories from playing them.

Command N Conquer (Potato Budget Edition), or below referred to as "this game," is not associated with, or endorsed by EA™, the owner of the Command & Conquer™ games.
This game is not intended to match or replace EA's Command & Conquer franchise, though the possibility of this game becoming more popular and completely dominating the market cannot be ruled out. 
Furthermore, this game is currently under early development, and game features may be limited, so it cannot be used as an accurate simulation for any plans of foreign invasions or domestic insurrections.
Colin, the author of this game, takes no responsibility for any damage or loss caused by the fun and exciting gameplay of this game.
